Django/web version
_A Long-term Stopwatch App_

# About

PADS is basically a web browser-operated version of those `days since` 
apps you find all over Google Play, App Store and such, but intended to
be accessible from about any device with a web browser and internet
access. If you wish, you can hack it to work offline or set up your own
instance in an intranet. And I promise, there will be no `special offers`
in this personally-sanctioned version of this app.

# Requirements
* Python 3.6
* Django (1.11.12)
* mod-wsgi (4.5.15)
* mysqlclient (1.3.10)
* pytz (2017.2)

PADS should work with later versions of the above dependencies either
out of the box, or with minimal changes.

# License

PADS is licensed under the MIT License, so you`re welcome to do whatever
you like to it, whether it`s improving your life, using it as the basis
of the next quantum leap in social media technology, or heaven forbid, 
adding `special offers`.
